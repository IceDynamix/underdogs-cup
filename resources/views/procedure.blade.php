                <h3 id="finding-your-matchup">1. Finding your matchup</h3>
                <p>

                    Check the <a href="">Challonge</a> for your matchup! The <a href="">Challonge bracket</a> will be
                    filled
                    roughly 5-10 minutes after check-ins have concluded.
                </p>

                <h3 id="contacting-your-opponent">2. Contacting your opponent</h3>
                <p>
                    Look for your opponent's Discord and ping them accordingly in the<code>#find-your-opponent</code>
                    channel.
                    Their Discord username should be the same as their Tetr.io username. If a player does not reply
                    within
                    10
                    minutes, please refer to <a href="/#no-show">No-Show</a>. If your match has been chosen as a
                    streamed
                    match,
                    please stand by and wait for staff instructions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Refer to: <a href="/#communication">Communication</a>
                </p>

                <h3 id="creating-the-room">3. Creating the room</h3>
                <p>
                    Once you've contacted the opponent, create a private Tetr.io room, invite your opponent and use the
                    appropriate command in the multiplayer room chat to set the tournament settings.
                </p>

                    <li>Matches until top 8:

                    </li>

                <h3 id="playing-the-match">4. Playing the match</h3>
                <p>
                    This should be the easiest part, it's what you came for in the end! Please refer to following rule
                    sections when necessary:
                </p>
                <ul class="incremental">
                    <li><a href="/#warmup">Warmup</a></li>
                    <li><a href="/#disconnect">Disconnect</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="posting-your-match-results">5. Posting your match results</h3>
                <p>
                    Once your match has concluded, make sure to send a screenshot of your match results into the <code>#match-results</code>
                    channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can make a screenshot on Windows 10 with the <code>Win+Shift+S</code>shortcut. This opens up the
                    new
                    snipping tool, which you can use to select an area to screenshot. The screenshot will be copied into
                    your
                    clipboard and can be pasted into Discord to post with <code>Ctrl+V</code>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Staff has to enter all results into Challonge manually, which can introduce delays in the early
                    stages of the tournament.
                </p>

                <h3 id="repeat-the-process">6. Repeat the process</h3>
                <p>
                    Look out for your next matchup and repeat the previous steps!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Challonge will update in real-time as staff members enter the results. If your matchup is empty,
                    then
                    please be patient and wait until the opponent matches have concluded and staff has entered the
                    results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do keep in mind that this tournament is Double Elimination, which
                    means that you have to lose twice to be eliminated from the tournament.
                    Good luck and have fun!
